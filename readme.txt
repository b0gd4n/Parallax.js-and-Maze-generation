A bit of experimentation with Parallax.js and web workers on maze generation using Prim's algorithm on a random graph.

The parallax effect also works with a mobile device gyro to recreate the effect.
The maze generation is used to fill the background with a generated colorfull maze.

For the web workers to load, you will need to install npm server using this command: 'npm install http-server -g' and run 'http-server' afterwards.
